## 1. Escaping the Microsoft Account Trap

Microsoft increasingly pressures users to connect to a Microsoft Account (MSA) during the Windows 11 Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE). For a lightweight and privacy-focused install, we need to bypass this requirement by forcing an offline setup.

While the older OOBE\BYPASSNRO command is often referenced, it is now deprecated or unreliable. The most consistent workaround is to disconnect the installation environment from the network entirely:

Disconnect: Ensure your computer is physically disconnected from the internet (unplug Ethernet or disable Wi-Fi on the installation machine).

Trigger Command Prompt: When the setup prompts you to connect to a network, press Shift + F10 to open the Command Prompt.

Force Local Account: Execute the following command:

<Pre language="powershell">
start ms-cxh:localonly
</Pre>

The installer will complain about the lack of connection but should now proceed directly to creating a local user account, allowing you to finalize the installation free of the immediate MSA requirement.

## 2. Essential CLI Setup with Winget

Once the OS is installed and you're logged into your new local account, the first step is enabling command-line package management.

Winget is Windows' native CLI package manager, mirroring tools like apt (Debian/Ubuntu) or brew (macOS). It’s invaluable for quickly installing and updating common developer tools and applications.

I recommend replacing the default browser right away. Microsoft Edge is functional, but Ungoogled Chromium offers a cleaner, more private experience from the start.

### 3. Automated Debloat and Tuning

Instead of manually digging through settings and uninstalling apps, the community has provided excellent automation scripts. 

The most famous is probably Chris Titus Tech's "[https://christitus.com/win](https://christitus.com/win)", which is highly regarded for its comprehensive, single-click approach to debloating, installing apps, and applying privacy tweaks.

To run the utility:

Open Elevated PowerShell: Find PowerShell, then hold Ctrl + Shift while Left-Clicking it to run it as an Administrator. (Avoid using the older PowerShell ISE environment).

Execute Script: Run the following command:

<Pre language="powershell">
irm https://christitus.com/win  | iex
</Pre>

This script will launch a graphical interface where you can select exactly which bloatware to remove, which essential drivers and utilities to install, and apply dozens of system tweaks to make Windows less intrusive.



If you are trying to debloat an already running system, I greatly recommend you to check Bulk Crap Uninstaller (BCU)



## 4. The Finishing Touch: PowerToys

For productivity, (Microsoft PowerToys)[https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys] is a must-install utility suite. It provides a set of highly useful tools that significantly enhance the Windows experience for power users.
