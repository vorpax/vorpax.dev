## Installing windows offline : A great beginning

Microsoft asks you to connect to the internet in order to login to your Microsoft account, and then install Windows, there.
There's an other way around : disconnect your computer from the internet.

Then it's gonna complain.

But by pressing Shift + F10 and the following command, you can still create a local account.

```shell
start ms-cxh:localonly
```

You might know the famous `OOBE\BYPASSNRO` command, but it doesn't work anymore...

## Quickly setup your new OS:

First, there is Winget which is Windows CLI package manager. It enables you to install packages and applications the same way you would do it with apt for Debian-based distros.


I usually install ungoogled-chromium as Edge is still a pain to work with.

Then I juste use https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil and the following PowerShell command (please make sure to run it as admin by doing Left-Click and holding Ctrl + Shift, then selecting PowerShell (preferably not the ISE one)) :

```powershell
irm "https://christitus.com/win" | iex
```


This script will help you install a lot of useful applications and tweak Windows settings to make it less intrusive.

Then I usually install Powertoys which is a great set of utilities to enhance Windows experience.
